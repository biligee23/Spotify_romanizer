Spotify Romanizer is a sophisticated web application designed for music lovers who want to bridge the language gap. It connects securely to your Spotify account and acts as a powerful companion, enhancing your listening experience with multi-format lyrics, advanced playlist management, and a dynamic, modern user interface.

## üöÄ Core Features

### üé§ Lyrics & Translation
- **Triple-View Lyrics:** Instantly switch between **Original Japanese**, **Romanized (Romaji)**, and **English** translated lyrics in a clean, tabbed interface.
- **Intelligent Lyric Fetching:** A smart algorithm finds the correct original Japanese lyrics on Genius by prioritizing the shortest, most relevant song titles, automatically filtering out derivative versions.
- **Embedded Music Video:** An official music video from YouTube is embedded directly on the track page for a complete audio-visual experience.

### üé® Dynamic & Responsive User Experience
- **Asynchronous Skeleton Loading:** Pages load instantly with a polished "skeleton" UI. The lyrics, video, and translation then populate seamlessly as the data is fetched by background Celery workers.
- **Real-Time UI Updates:** All major actions‚Äîfavoriting a song, adding to a playlist, reordering tracks‚Äîhappen instantly on the page without requiring a full page reloads, creating a smooth, modern SPA-like feel.
- **Dynamic Theming:** The track and artist pages feature a beautiful, dynamic background gradient that is generated from the dominant colors of the album or artist artwork.
- **Polished Hover Effects:** Album art comes to life with a stylish, theme-aware "duotone" hover effect.

### üìö Personalized Music Library & Management
- **Favorites & History:** Every song you view is automatically added to your personal library, which is intelligently separated into a permanent "Favorites" list and a temporary "History" list, managed by an LFU caching policy.
- **Self-Healing Cache:** If a background task fails (e.g., a translation), the app will automatically re-trigger the task the next time you visit the page, ensuring your data eventually becomes complete.
- **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple songs at once to favorite, unfavorite, or add them to a playlist in a single, efficient action.

### üé∂ Advanced Playlist Tools
- **Full Playlist Management:** View, rename, and delete your Spotify playlists directly from the app.
- **Duplicate-Free Adding:** When adding songs to an existing playlist, the app automatically checks for and skips any tracks that are already present.
- **Asynchronous Creation:** New playlists are created in the background, so your UI is never blocked.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:**
    - **Tracks:** Reorder tracks within a playlist, and the changes are instantly saved to your Spotify account.
    - **Playlists:** Create a custom, persistent order for your main playlist view inside the app.
- **Bulk Cache Priming:** Pre-load all the lyrics for an entire playlist with a single click, with a live progress bar to track the status.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup & Installation

This project is fully containerized, making local setup incredibly simple and consistent.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) & Docker Compose
- Git

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/spotify-romanizer.git
cd spotify-romanizer```

### Step 2: Configure Your API Keys (Crucial Step)
This application requires credentials from Spotify, Genius, and YouTube to function.
1.  **Create your `.env` file** by copying the provided template. This file is where you will store your secret keys.
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
2.  **Get Your Credentials:**
    -   **Spotify:** Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to create an app and get your Client ID and Secret.
    -   **Genius:** Go to the [Genius API page](https://genius.com/api-clients) to create a client and get your Access Token.
    -   **YouTube:** Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to create a project, enable the "YouTube Data API v3", and get an API Key.
3.  **Fill in the `.env` file:** Open the `.env` file you just created and paste in your keys.
4.  **Set Spotify Redirect URI:** In your Spotify Developer Dashboard, you **must** add `http://localhost:5000/callback` to the list of "Redirect URIs" in your app's settings.

### Step 3: Build & Run the Application
With your configuration in place, this single command will build and run the entire application stack.
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- The `--build` flag is only needed the first time or after changing dependencies. For subsequent runs, you can just use `docker-compose up`.
- You will see logs from the `web`, `worker`, and `redis` services. Wait for them to stabilize.

### Step 4: Access Spotify Romanizer
Once the containers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
### [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
You should be greeted by the login page. Enjoy the application!

### Stopping the Application
- To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
- To remove the containers and all associated network resources, run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & Future Ideas

-   **YouTube API Quota:** The application uses the YouTube Data API v3 to find music videos. The default daily quota provided by Google for a new project is **10,000 units**. Each search query costs **100 units**. This means the application can perform approximately **100 searches for uncached songs per day**. Once this limit is reached, new YouTube videos will not be found until the quota resets at midnight PST. This limitation is a primary reason for the robust caching system and the "Bulk Cache Priming" feature.
-   **Future Enhancements:** A potential future improvement would be to integrate Spotify's Audio Analysis API to display features like Danceability, Energy, and Tempo, and allow users to sort their playlists by these metrics.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Original Work & Licensing Philosophy

This project was conceived and developed from the ground up as a portfolio piece to showcase modern web application architecture and a high-quality user experience. All of the core application code in the `src/` directory is my own original work.

The choice of the **GNU GPLv3 license** is a deliberate one, made to reflect the following principles:
1.  **Freedom to Learn:** I strongly believe in the open-source ethos of sharing knowledge. Anyone is free to clone, run, and study this codebase to learn from its patterns and implementation.
2.  **Protection from Commercialization:** The "copyleft" nature of the GPLv3 ensures that while this project is open for all to see and learn from, it cannot be absorbed into a closed-source, proprietary commercial product. If any company uses this code as part of a distributed product, they must release the full source code of their product under the same terms.
3.  **Sharing is Caring:** If you adapt this code to create and distribute your own cool project, you are required to share your source code under the same license, ensuring the community continues to benefit.
